NAME
	celib - Unix/WinANSI library for WinCE

DESCRIPTION
	This library is for easier porting Win32 and Unix programs to
	WinCE. It currently contains parts from NetBSD.

	Environment vars are read from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Environment.

	Most functions are prefixed with xce... The header celib.h
	defines most xce-functions to their real name when included in
	a non-library-build.

	This library is in no way well-designed and well-tested. I
	wrote it to get Emacs running. Use at your own risk.

COMPILING
	If you want to recompile the library, you probably have to fix
	some paths in the makefile.

	You also need to patch some files from Microsoft's CRT library.
	Look in the file xpatch.bat and fix the path of the CRT
	sources (these are not installed by default when you setup 
	VC 6.0!). Then run xpatch.bat. This generates some
	time-specific files. It's a pain that Microsoft did not
	implement these - and other crt funcs - in it's coredll.
	ActiveX seems to be more important...

UNSUPPORTED
	* pipe(), dup(), dup2()

PROBLEMS
	* Passing current directory to child processes is done via
	  PWD in the *global* environment. This could be done in other
	  ways, but no one is running a lot apps simultanously...
	
TODO
	* Clean up naming etc.
	* Optionally build as DLL.
	* Thread-Safety.
	* Stdio should be replaced, to support sockets etc.
